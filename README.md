# Data Analytics Project Using Excel
Today I am going to perform a Data Analytics Project using excel, I had been doing the Data Analysis Bootcamp by AlexTheAnalyst which is available on YouTube. [Link](https://youtu.be/opJgMj1IUrc?si=PEnrUNpTFdZRd5FI)
I will be using the dataset which was provided in the YouTube

### Cleaning the Data
The Data which is provided to us is never fully clean hence we need to clean out the data and we're gonna do that in the following steps

-  Removing Duplicates
-  Expanding Short-forms
- And Checking to see if there are irregular values in the data

### Converting to Pivot Table
To summarise the data or generate the insights that we want  to make we need to make a pivot table of the raw data provided

Here we have made a table which shows the Average Income vs Bike Bought? [Per Gender] So we have shown 3 values here.

Now a Pivot Table showing, Count of Bikes Sold vs Commute Distance

Now a last pivot table showing Average Income vs Age Bracket

### Visualizing the said Pivot Table Data
Now I will be posting the visualizations made by the 3 Pivot Tables.
